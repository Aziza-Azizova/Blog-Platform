## Description

The Blog Platform API allows users to register, log in, and manage blogs and comments.
Users can create, edit, delete, and view blogs. Other users can leave comments on blogs. The
system supports role-based access control (admin and regular users) to ensure secure
content management. Pagination is implemented for viewing blog posts.
